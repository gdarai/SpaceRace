QUEST   #  D11      #  Space Fuel # 402
TEXT    #  So you have some crude oil to run your diesel generators. Well that is not enough to get you into space. You know how to make a proper Rocket Fuel, but for that you need a proper Chemical Reactor and that is something you can not build just yet.\n\nSo here is an alternative road. Using Industrial Mixer and Forestry Fermenter, you can get a fluid powerful enough that you can turn it into Rocket Fuel in the basic Industrial Refinery.\n\nIt is expensive but doable.
