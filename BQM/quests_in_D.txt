TEXT    #  So you have some crude oil to run your diesel generators. Well that is not enough to get you into space. You know how to make a proper Rocket Fuel, but for that you need a proper Chemical Reactor and that is something you can not build just yet.\n\nSo here is an alternative road. Using Industrial Mixer and Forestry Fermenter, you can get a fluid powerful enough that you can turn it into Rocket Fuel in the basic Industrial Refinery.\n\nIt is expensive but doable.

Construct in it a Satellite with an Optical Sensor and a pair of Basic Solar Panels. Keep the Satellite ID Chip.\n\nBuild a rocket which will not have a seat, but a Satellite Bay instead. Put the Satellite into that bay and launch the rocket. For remote launching a rocket, you will need a Rocket Monitoring Station been linked to that rocket.\n\nBuild a Satellite Monitoring Station. Put in the Satellite ID chip and watch the data slowly flow in.
