QUEST   #  E00      #  Mining in the Belt # 500
TEXT    #  There is also another moon orbiting this gas giant. The Belt. Asteroid belt is an unbelievably dangerous place. Unfortunately it is also the only place near by where you can find Ardite and Cobalt. Before you will go there understand this.\n\nIt is very hard to land there. Expect that you may loose your rocket and everything on it in your landing attempt. It will simply miss all the asteroids and fall into the void.\n\nSo, it is recommended to be able to fly or glide, so you can leave the rocket in case of emergency. And it is also good to have everything you need to build a second rocket in your pocket so you will be able to get out of there. Good trick is to move your launch platform so your next rockets will not be lost or just build a base on the place where you expect to land next time.

QUEST   #  E10      #  Building your Warp Ship # 501
TEXT    #  The next step is to build a Warp Ship, because all the other materials you need are not in this Gas Giant's vicinity. Start by building a launch pad similar to the one you have for your ship, but larger. Place Space Station Assembling Machine next to it instead of the Rocket Assembling Machine.\n\nBuild the core of your space station on this platform. Your first rocket flying to your space station will land on this platform, so be careful with the design. Also you may want to put there a Landing Pad which will tells your rocket, where to land exactly.\n\nTo pack the station, put in the Assembler a Space Station ID chip and a Satellite Bay.
