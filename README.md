# SpaceRace
Minecraft Modpack

Instalation notes
The files here does not contain info about what mods are in which versions, So you cannot install the modpack from here.
However that can be done through Curse link: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/darais-space-race

Well so why is it here? Good question. If you want to make a quick update, you can download the new files simpley from here.
Then just paste whatever is in the ThePackFiles folder into your Minecraft SpaceRace clone and you are done.

What are the other folders? Those contain some additional pack information. Documents used for planning, Scripts used for building/generating the pack files.
